Global AI investment surged from $12.75 million in 2015 to $93.5 billion in 2021, and the market is projected to reach $422.37 billion by 2028. While this outlook might make it sound as if generative AI is the “silver bullet” for pushing our global society forward, it comes with an important footnote: The ethical implications are not yet well-defined. This is a severe problem that can inhibit continued growth and expansion.

According to Layoffs.fyi, as of mid-November, more than 45,000 workers in the U.S. tech industry, at giants such as Netflix and Twitter, have been laid off this month alone. A New York Times article addresses a cycle of aggressive expansions, corporate excess and wild talent wars to secure the best and brightest. Rapidly expanding headcount, fast growth over profits and being caught in a tech bubble have been cited as some of the causes for the ongoing layoffs. Unfortunately, the onslaught of layoff news comes with the economic uncertainty felt on a global scale following a worldwide pandemic. Ebbs and flows of the economy are not new, and each generation has experienced several in their lifetimes. But how can businesses prepare for such uncertain times and reduced workforces — particularly in tech?

It’s a variant of their popular GPT-3 model, which was trained on a large dataset of human conversation. ChatGPT is designed to be able to generate human-like responses to text input in a variety of different styles and formats. It can be used for a variety of applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation. What technology is ChatGPT based on? ChatGPT is built on the same technology as GPT-3, which is a type of artificial neural network called a transformer. This is a deep learning model that’s able to process input text and generate output text by learning to predict the next word in a sequence. In the case of ChatGPT, the model has been trained on a large dataset of human conversation, so it’s able to generate responses that sound more natural and human-like than previous models.
